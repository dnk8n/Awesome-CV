Nov. 2019, actively pursuing Reinforcement learning (RL) by self studying seminal
RL book by Sutton and Barto, together with the associated RL Coursera Specialization.
May. 2018, I entered the retro contest hosted by OpenAI (placed 32/229). Realized I
needed a more foundational knowledge about the algorithms to compete. Been following
the field ever since.
Spinning Up provides me with a convenient platform to experiment with practical
applications.
I am also exploring application of Deep RL to micro-simulations
using FLOW by UC Berkely.

Enthusiastic about the architecture of JAMstack. I have set up personal websites
for small business communities with little access to tech skills using Hugo static
site generator and NetlifyCMS.
