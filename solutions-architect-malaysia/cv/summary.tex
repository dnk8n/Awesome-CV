Remote working techie who enjoys living in fun and adventurous locations off the beaten track. Currently residing in Kosi Bay where I get to do
things like watch baby turtles hatching, dive and snorkel beautiful reefs, pop over to Mozambique for day trips, sleep in caves in the middle of
nowhere.
During the week I am connected up to electricity and wifi, eyes glued to a laptop screen all day, navigating the internet for answers to problems
which need solving. I enjoy programming, data science and statistics. Fascinated by artificial intelligence and machine learning, something I am
getting more and more involved in.
Eager to learn and pass on knowledge. Strive at all times to ‘be the mentor I wish I had’.
I value a company which contributes to free and open-source projects. I am specifically looking for a company providing solutions which have a
meaningful impact to society, especially focusing on solving the problems of those in the bottom of the wealth pyramid.
